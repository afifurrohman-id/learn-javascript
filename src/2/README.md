# Variable in JavaScript

First before Javascript es6
```var name = 'afif'``` this is a wrong way to create a variable in javascript for (now), why ??. 

because you can use a variable before initialize and not error
(This is big problem)

### Now
- Create variable using let
> let is keyword in javascript for create a variable and can reassign it
```let a = 1```
and  you can reassign the variable ```a = 2```

- Create a variable using const
> const is keyword in javascript for create a variable and you can't reassign it
```const name = 'afif'``` you cannot reassign the variable, for example ```name = 'michael'``` this is give you error

### Rules 
> You cannot use number before the name of variable, for example: ``` const 0id = 5 ``` **X**. This is not valid variable in javascript
